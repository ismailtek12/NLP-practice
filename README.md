# NLP-practice

### Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) techniques in extracting relevant abstracts from a collection of research papers.
By leveraging Faiss, GloVe, and Word2Vec, we aim to achieve fast and accurate search results for given search queries.

### Technologies Used
Faiss: Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, commonly used for large-scale vector retrieval in NLP applications.
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation): GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining word embeddings. We will use pre-trained GloVe embeddings to represent words in our abstracts.
Word2Vec: Word2Vec is another popular technique for obtaining word embeddings, and we will also experiment with Word2Vec embeddings for comparison.
